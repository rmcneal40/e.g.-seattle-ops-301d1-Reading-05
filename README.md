Robert McNeal 3/1/22 What Is Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday? Sometimes called “Update Tuesday,” Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software applications, including Microsoft Office.  As Microsoft patches security vulnerabilities, it doesn’t release those patches immediately. Instead, the company gathers those fixes into a larger update, which is released on Patch Tuesday.  Microsoft does this to make the update process as predictable as possible for administrators. IT professionals know that patches will arrive on the second Tuesday of each month, and they can make plans to test or install them. It should be easier than continually applying smaller patches and more predictable than huge patches arriving on a random day of the month.
